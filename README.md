### **Founded:** 2011

*Jonathan Levin   -->* The current CSO of Chainalsyis. Jonathan was previoulsy the CEO at Coinometrics, a company focused on monitoring the health of the Bitcoin blockchain. 

### **Basic Idea:**

```"Chainalysis is the blockchain analysis company. We provide compliance and investigation software to the worldâ€™s leading banks, businesses, and governments. Our experts in financial crime and blockchain analysis empower customers to derive insights they can act on." -Chainalsysis Website```


### **Funding:**
According to reports from [Finance Magnates](https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/chainalysis-expands-series-b-funding-with-a-further-13m-funding/) and [Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/chainalysis/company_financials), Chainalysis has raised between $49-66.6 million dollars over six rounds of funding. Most recently, they raised a 13 million dollar Series B round on July 7, 2020. 


## **Business Activities**

### **Bringing Reg-Tech to Crypto:**

Chainalysis is, at its foundation, a *Reg-Tech* company masquerading as blockchain innovation in the crypto domain. 

Cryptocurrencies are a bleeding edge technology, barely more than ten years new. The idea of cryptos is to open up financial markets in a new, fair, and decentralized manner. The rise of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other chain based cryptos is only the tip of the iceberg for this transformative technologgy. 

However, this new system of account, this world of blockchain, needs greater trust and transparency in order to maximize its potential and become fully mainstream. 

*Chainalysis* was created to "implement clear regulations, establish standard audit practices, and implement powerful compliance controls for cryptocurrencies."

### **Customer Base and Market Size**

Chainalsysis is the right hand man of the United States' government in the race to regulate cryptocurrencies. Starting with a [$9000 dollar software contract for the FBI in 2015](https://www.coindesk.com/inside-chainalysis-multimillion-dollar-relationship-with-the-us-government), the relationship between he U.S. and Chainalsyis has ballooned to 82 records of Federal Contracts and $14 million dollars. 

The idea of Chainalysis as an audit software for blockchains to snuff out illegal activity, pairs well with big business and government. 

While the details are hazy on what exactly these government agencies are purchasing, the overall idea of mass training, understanding, and software tools to track blockchain techonology has proved fruitful.

Beside government agencies, the customer base and market size is hard to track due to a lack of information on sales. 

However, as a reg-tech company within the blockchain industry, the opportunities are endless. 

As of now, Chainalsysis is offering a three pronged approach to customer base. Beside the aforementioned government side, they also focus on Cryptocurrency Business and Financial Instiutions.

They help businesses with software that offers real-time, automated views of transactions in order to combat money laundering risks.

For financial institutions, they offer software training in understanding crypto activity in order to make sound, informed decisions about existing or future customers. 


### **Current Technology**

*Chainalsysis KYT:* The bread and of Chainalysis' business and their first product ever offered. KYT, short for Know Your Transaction, is a high-risk activity detector that offers real time alerts, in-depth investigation, and an integrated work flow experience. 

*Chainalysis Reactor:* This piece of software is a crypto wallet/address tracker. By scanning the web and darknet sites, it connects social media activity, exchange interactions, and all sorts of information in order to understand the flow of money throughout blockchains. 

*Chainalysis Kryptos:* This product is a watchdog for over 1800 cryptcurrency businesses that are connected to on-chain activity. It offers comprehensive profiles, monitors risky transactions, and benchmarks industry data. 

*Our Data:* A product that is the "and more" for Chainalysis. It offers multi-blockchain support and data that stands up in court. 


## **Landscape**:

### **Domain:**

Chainalsysis was first to the party in bringing Reg-tech to the crypto industry. The day Jonathan Levin stood up in court and testified that Chainalsysis had located [650,000 missing bitcoin stolen from Mt. Gox](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeldelcastillo/2019/07/16/cryptocurrency-crimefighter-chainalysis-joins-next-billion-dollar-startups/#73f4d30aace0) completely changed the game. By combing through the blockchain, Chainalysis had uncovered and tracked over 1 billion dollars in good thought lost forever due to theft. 

As the first mover, Chainalysis has an advantage, but must keep adapting to the ever changing crypto space.
